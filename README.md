# Prework Study Guide Webpage


## Description

This website represents the first project I have completed for UT's coding bootcamp. 
The purpose of this website is to provide a nice and easy study guide for myself and others in the course.
Throughout this project, I have been exposed to HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. Although these are just the 
basics, it is a valuable start. Notes that I have taken and notes that have been suggested by others can be 
found on this website.

## Usage

You can use this website to help you recall certain elements from the course that we have covered so far.
For suggestions on what to study first, open the ChromeDevTools by pressing (Command+Option+I)MacOS or (Control+Shift+I)Windows.
A console panel should open either just below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics
that we have learned so far and a suggestion of what to study first.
